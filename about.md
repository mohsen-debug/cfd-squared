I am a CFD engineer with a passion for understanding how numerical modeling and 
simulations can solve real world problems more efficiently. Here I keep track of
different projects that I have worked on and some nitty-gritty CFD stuff that I 
tend to forget! More about me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mohsenka/).
