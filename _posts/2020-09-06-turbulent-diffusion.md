title: Coding turbulent diffusion coefficient for a scalar equation
---

Let's start by dissecting the title, since it's quite a mouthful one! First thing 
first, I am dealing with a turbulent flow then I am solving a scalar equation and I 
got to code something, so UDF stuff! It might sound a bit daunting, but it is 
rather a simple problem, yet the typical written resources are all over the 
place. I decided to gather bits and pieces from here and there and put everything 
into a step-by-step and easy-to-follow blog post.

### What's the problem?

I am simulating a turbulent gas-liquid system and the gas bubbles, let's say 
they are pure oxygen bubbles, dissolve into the liquid, water for example. To 
take care of the two phases I can simply use Eulerian-Eulerian framework in 
Fluent and that's well documented. So no need to talk about it!

Now I need to do something with the fact that oxygen is diffusing into the water.
A straightforward method is to use the species transport equation 
already available in Fluent, and possibly make my life easier. I would just go over 
`define/models/species` to enable it and ask Fluent nicely to solve the
following equation:

$$ \frac{\partial\left(\alpha_{q} \rho_{q} Y_{q}^{i}\right)}{\partial t}+\nabla \cdot\left(\alpha_{q} \rho_{q} \vec{U}_{q} Y_{q}^{i}\right)=-\nabla \cdot\left(\alpha_{q} \vec{J}_{q}^{i}\right)+\alpha_{q} R_{q}^{i}+\alpha_{q} S_{q}^{i}+\sum_{p=1}^{n} \dot{m}_{p^{i} q^{j}}~~~(1)$$

In this equation $$Y_i^q$$ is the mass fraction of oxygen in phase $$q$$ and I have to
figure out what to do with the right hand side of the equation. Let's make it a
bit simpler and assume there is no chemical reactions in the system producing 
oxygen, then the second term with $$R_q^i$$ is gone. Also there isn't any external 
sources of $$O_2$$ and I can cross out $$S_q^i$$. The last term on the RHS 
tells me about the transfer of oxygen at the interface. This can be closed by 
knowing or calculating the overall mass transfer coefficient, $$k_l$$, and the 
available interfacial area, $$a$$, which is another story for itself perhaps for
 another time. I have left with only the first term on RHS. This represents the 
 diffusion flux of $$O_2$$ because of concentration gradient at the interface. 
 Fluent uses Fick's law to deal with this term and for a 
 *turbulent flow* the following formulation is applied:

$$ \vec{J}_{q}^{i} =-\left(\rho D_{i, lam}+\frac{\mu_{t}}{Sc_{turb}}\right) \nabla Y_{q}^{i}~~~(2) $$

This expression accounts for laminar, $$D_{i,lam}$$, and turbulent diffusion, 
$$D_{i,turb}$$, coefficients and that is what I am trying to code into Fluent.
This is the problem that I am trying to address and I can now go over how to 
actually solve it.

### Do I need to write my own UDF?
Yes! but it's easy.

Instead of enabling the species equation, I focus on formulating the 
diffusion of oxygen into the system by solving two User Defined Scalars or in 
short **UDSs**. One for the mass fraction of oxygen in the gas bubbles and the 
second one for the mass fraction of $$O_2$$ in liquid phase. The general form of 
an UDS for a multiphase system reads as below:

$$\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\left(\alpha_{l} \rho_{l} Y_{l}^{O_{2}}\right)+\nabla \cdot\left(\alpha_{l} \rho_{l} U_{l} Y_{l}^{O_{2}}\right)=\nabla \cdot\left(\alpha_{l} \rho_{l} D_{eff}^{O_{2}} \nabla Y_{l}^{O_{2}}\right)+S_{l}^{O_{2}}~~~(3)$$


As there is no resistance for the diffusion of oxygen within the bubble, the 
diffusion term for the mass fraction of oxygen in bubble is 
neglected. However, for the liquid phase I need to define the diffusion 
coefficient. Another important point to remember is that the UDS equation in 
Fluent is always solved for laminar flow and since I am dealing with a turbulent
 system I should modify the diffusion term in the UDS equation. I decompose the 
 diffusion into the laminar and turbulent components:

$$D_{eff} = D_{lam} + D_{turb}~~~(4)$$

The $$D_{lam}$$ term is what I read from reference books. For example table 6 on
[Compilation of Henry's law constants for water as solvent](https://acp.copernicus.org/articles/15/4399/2015/)
by Sander defines the value of $$D_{lam}$$ according to different measurements. 
The turbulent diffusion coefficient is formulated based on turbulent Schmidt 
number, $$Sc_{turb}$$:

$$Sc_{turb} = \frac{\mu_t}{\rho D_{turb}}~~~(5)$$

Replacing Eq. 5 into Eq. 4, I can re-write the effective diffusion coefficient:

$$ D_{eff} = D_{lam} + \frac{\mu_t}{\rho Sc_{turb}}~~~(6) $$

This is now pretty clear because as long as I know $$Sc_{turb}$$ and $$\mu_t$$ then 
the effective turbulent diffusion is computed seamlessly. I use Fluent macro 
`C_MU_T(c,t)` to retrieve the value of turbulent viscosity. For the turbulent 
Schmidt number, I can use the recommended value for of $$0.7$$ for $$k-\varepsilon$$ 
model or $$1$$ for $$RSM$$. 

There is one last point before coding $$D_{eff}$$. Looking at 
Fluent material properties menu:

title="Diffusivity Unit" class="align-center" />

The diffusivity unit is $$kg/m \cdot s$$ that tells me Fluent multiply the diffusion 
coefficient by density. So the final form of the expression for $$D_{eff}$$ is:

$$D_{eff} = \rho D_{lam} + \frac{\mu_t}{Sc_{turb}}~~~(7)$$

The simplest way to start writing a UDF is to search through the UDF manual and 
most probably you find something that is very
similar to what you want. So I also did that and I found `DEFINE_DIFFUSIVITY`
macro that does exactly what I want. I build up my code based on the example 
provided by the manual. The final UDF looks like below and I've added extensive 
comments to explain what each line is doing.
```c
DEFINE_DIFFUSIVITY(uds_diff_coeff,c,t,i)
{
    /* Note: the diffusivity in GUI requires rho*D */
    real schmidt, D_turb, D_eff, mu_turb;

    /* assign D_eff as laminar diff coeff based on Sander book for O2*/
    D_eff = 2.1e-9;

    /* Multiply this by the density, C_R(c,t): retrieve density */
    D_eff *= C_R(c,t);

    /* If turbulence is off, then mu_turb = 0.0, and D_eff = D_lam */
    if (rp_turb)
    {
        /* Turbulent viscosity */
        mu_turb = C_MU_T(c,t);
        
        /* Schmidt number */
        schmidt = 0.7;

        /* Turbulent diffusivity (* rho) based on Sc number for k-e */
        D_turb = mu_turb / schmidt;

        /* Effective diffusivity (* rho): summation of laminar and turbulent */
        D_eff += D_turb;
    }
    return D_eff;
}
```
After compiling, the UDF name in this case `uds_diff_coeff` shows up on the 
material properties window where I can hook it up to the calculations.

### Remarks or what did I say?

- Species diffusion can be solved using different UDSs in Fluent.
- UDS is solved for laminar flow in Fluent.
- Diffusivity is multiplied by density.
- UDF is required to modify diffusion coefficient.
