title: Hydrocyclone (2009-2010)
---

The modeling of hydrocyclone was the first research project that I worked on. 
During my master thesis I modeled the separation behavior of this device 
through experiments, analytical models and CFD for optimization of separation 
in an iron-processing plant. The **Response Surface Method** of **DOE** was 
applied to optimized the effective parameters on the separation efficiency. 
The video below shows the flow pattern in a transparent lab-scale hydrocyclone 
that I designed and manufactured during my work.

Using Gambit and Fluent, **Large Eddy Simulations (LES)** were performed to simulate the flow through the domain. To capture the central air-core the **Volume of Fluid, (VOF)** was utilized. The videos below show the flow patterns and air-core development inside the computational domain.
