I worked for 2 years on developing fundamental models for improving the 
understanding of droplet and gas bubble breakup in turbulent flows. The idea 
was to improve the breakup kernels for population balance equation to account 
for the entire turbulent energy spectrum via simulations and experimental 
validations. For instance the following plot shows the level of improvement 
achieved by including the entire turbulent spectrum in one of the breakup models
 (see the green lines). More details about this work is summarized in 
 [this presentation](/cfd-squared/assets/pdf/breakup_modeling.pdf).

Additionally, high resolved simulations with dynamic mesh refinements were 
used to investigate the stochastic outcome from the droplet breakup. The 
simulations were validated in terms of droplet deformation time, number of 
fragments and specific breakup rates. Using the concept of energy barrier, it 
was found that the number of fragments are correlated with the interaction 
between turbulent eddies and droplets. The results of this work is relevant for
mixing industries with the dominant presence of micro-bubbles.
